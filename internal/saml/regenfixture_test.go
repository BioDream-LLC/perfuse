// Regenerating the Entra fixture without the identifiers of the tenant it came from.
//
// Why this exists rather than the captured document being kept as it arrived. A real assertion names the directory that issued it: the tenant
// identifier, the object identifier of the account, and a user principal name containing the domain. None of that is secret in the cryptographic
// sense, and all of it identifies a specific organisation and person, which a published test fixture should not.
//
// The document cannot simply be edited, because it is signed. Changing one character of it invalidates the signature, and the signature is the
// entire point: five tests use this fixture to check that verification succeeds against a document written the way Microsoft writes one, with no
// namespace prefixes on Assertion or Signature. Keycloak's fixture covers the opposite case. Those are the two sides of the canonicalisation
// handling that was once wrong here, so losing either halves the coverage.
//
// So the values are replaced and the document is signed again with a key generated here. What is preserved is the thing the tests rely on: the
// shape. Element and attribute order, the absence of prefixes, the placement of the signature inside the assertion, and the claim URIs are all as
// Entra produced them. What changes is the identifiers and the key.
//
// Skipped unless PERFUSE_REGEN_FIXTURES is set, because it rewrites files in testdata. Run it with:
//
//	PERFUSE_REGEN_FIXTURES=1 go test ./internal/saml/ -run TestRegenerateEntraFixture
//
// The check that this worked is not inside this test. It is that the five tests in entraassertion_test.go still pass afterwards - the verifier is
// the oracle, and a fixture it accepts is a fixture that exercises the path.
