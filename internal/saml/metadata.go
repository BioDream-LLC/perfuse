// Reading an identity provider's metadata document.
//
// Why this exists. Every SAML provider publishes one of these, and until now Perfuse asked an operator to do the extraction by hand: find
// the signing certificate in the XML, strip the whitespace out of the base64, wrap it in PEM headers with the right line breaks, and paste
// the sign-on URL separately. That is XML surgery as a configuration step, and a certificate with a stray space in it fails with a
// signature error that says nothing about formatting.
//
// It is also the difference between configuring SAML from the browser and only appearing to. The panel accepted a certificate and a URL,
// which is not the same as being able to point Perfuse at a provider.
//
// What it deliberately does not do. It does not fetch. A parser that reaches out to a URL of its own accord is one that can be aimed at an
// internal address by whoever can edit the configuration, so fetching is the caller's business and happens where that decision is visible.
//
// Element names are matched without namespaces on purpose. Entra writes them unprefixed, Keycloak and Shibboleth use md:, ADFS has used
// both, and all of them are the same document. Go's encoding/xml matches any namespace when a tag names only a local element, which is the
// tolerant reading and the correct one here.
