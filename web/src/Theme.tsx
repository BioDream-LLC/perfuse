/**
 * Theme choice, held on the document and remembered.
 *
 * # Why this is three lines of state and no component changes
 *
 * Every colour utility in the interface compiles to a CSS variable, so a theme is a set of variable values under a
 * data-theme selector. Switching one attribute on the root element retheme fourteen hundred utilities across sixty files.
 * Nothing else has to know, which is the only reason offering three themes is a reasonable thing to do rather than a
 * rewrite.
 *
 * # Why it is stored per browser rather than per account
 *
 * A theme is a property of where somebody is sitting, not of who they are. The same operator wants midnight on the wall
 * display in the server room and light on the laptop by the window, and an account-level setting would fight them. It also
 * means the choice survives with no server round trip and works before sign-in.
 *
 * # Why the system preference is only a default
 *
 * Following prefers-color-scheme forever would override a deliberate choice the moment the operating system changed at
 * sunset. It is consulted once, when nobody has chosen yet, and then the person's own choice wins for good.
